This workshop provides basic guidance on the <tt>LaTeX</tt> environment, including:

* Different IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)
* Basic notation (commands)
* Use of packages and different file extensions (<tt>Bib, Tex, Rtex, cls</tt>)
* Creation of different document classes (Article, Report, Beamer)
* Use of mathematical notation
* Integration of <tt>LaTeX</tt> and <tt>R</tt> (through <tt>knitr</tt>)

Most of the content is based on the Introduction to LaTeX course offered by Prof. Miguel V. S. Frasson (USP). His website with all the links and contents of his LaTeX course can be assessed at: <https://sites.icmc.usp.br/frasson/latex/index.html>.

We adapted Prof. Frasson's material to reflect the following updates:

* Replaced the information about <tt>ShareLatex</tt> with the new <tt>Overleaf</tt> online <tt>LaTeX</tt> editor and compiler
* Included a hole new section on how to integrate <tt>LaTeX</tt> and <tt>R</tt> (through <tt>knitr</tt>)

**Note:** Please make sure you have <tt>R</tt> installed in your computer.
